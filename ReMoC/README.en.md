# ReMoC

#### Description
Renmin Mobility Calculator (ReMoC) is a computer code for carrier mobility calculations of semiconductors based on outputs from computer package ``Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). Here, the carrier mobility is calculated using the deformation potential theory for band transport solids which approximates that electrons are dominately scatterred by  long acoustic(LA) phonons. A crossover function is introduced to bridge exact 2D layer and 3D bulk-like materials, which leads to better descriptions for layered materials with finite thicknesses.

#### Environment Requirement

1. VASP **5.4.4** 
2. Python **3.x** 
3. numpy **>=1.12.1**

#### Installation

Please refer to the installation file.

#### Instructions

 Please refer to the fitmobility-guide file for first using.

 **For more  details please refer to following papers. And please cite them if you use this code to calculate carrier mobility.**
